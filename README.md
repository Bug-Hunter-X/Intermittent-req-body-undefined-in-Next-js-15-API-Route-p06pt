# Next.js 15 API Route: Intermittent req.body undefined

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where `req.body` in an API route is intermittently undefined, even when using the POST method and setting the correct `Content-Type` header.

## Bug Description

The problem is that `req.body` is undefined in the API route handler, despite sending a POST request with a JSON payload and setting the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This behavior is inconsistent; sometimes `req.body` is correctly populated, and other times it remains undefined.  The cause is not readily apparent.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Send a POST request to `/api/route` with a JSON payload (e.g., using Postman or curl).
5. Observe that `req.body` is sometimes undefined.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `next/server` middleware to parse the body correctly, as provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Additional Notes

This bug has been observed in Next.js 15 and may be related to middleware configuration or other factors that are not yet fully understood. The provided solution addresses the issue in the specific context of this example.
